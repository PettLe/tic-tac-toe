The beginning was slow as it seems to be with these current projects. But it's fine and I've learned to take it slow on purpose. It always feels so
overwhelming to start a new project without having any idea what to do. But instead of staring at the empty screen for hours trying to figure the whole thing in my
head, I just slowly start to piece together the small (empty) functions and HTML + CSS that I know I'm going to need. Seems to work.

By far biggest problem was pushing the right value to the array. Eventually e.target.getAttribute to the rescue! Worked like a charm.
Little bit struggles with the winning conditions. I used a bunch of if... else if -statements and I'm sure there is a waaay more elegant solution.
But at least everything else turned out fairly clean, no global variables (which I used to think are the best!) and everything is nicely contained.
Tried to make it so players don't have access to where they shouldn't.

Creating players and their markers... it feels I somehow oversimplified it. Can it really be as minimalistic and simple as I made it to be? Am I forgetting something?

Div display for the winner is difficult. I managed to create it fairly simple, but removing it (as restarting the game) is a problem.
